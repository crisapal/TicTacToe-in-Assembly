# TicTacToe-in-Assembly
TicTacToe using Intel x86 instruction set in order to understand the core operations on a general purpose register and addressing modes.


How is it working?
This code is divided in 3 main procedures: 

- loading the game's board - made out of a macro using char strings
- marking a player's move
- validation function
